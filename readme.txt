I used SWI Prolog to do this assignment.

There is a different file for each of the 5 questions in the assignment.
The testing for each question has been filled in to different text files named Q#Test.txt

Contained Files:

Question1.pl
Question2.pl
Question3.pl
Question4.pl
Question5.pl
Q1Test.txt
Q2Test.txt
Q3Test.txt
Q4Test.txt
Q5Test.txt
readme.txt

Some of the procedure names are not the same as in the assignment description
because SWI prolog was throwing warnings which I did want to appear.
